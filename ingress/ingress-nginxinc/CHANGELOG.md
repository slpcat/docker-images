* [62](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/62): Add the `nginx.org/ssl-services` annotation, which allows load balancing of HTTPS applications. Thanks to [Julian](https://github.com/jmastr).

### 0.4.0

* [54](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/54): Previously, when specifying the port of a service in an Ingress rule, you had to use the value of the target port of that port of the service, which was incorrect.

The latest version is available through the `latest` tag.

The previous version was 0.3


### Notes

* Except when mentioned otherwise, the controller refers both to the NGINX and the NGINX Plus Ingress controllers.
